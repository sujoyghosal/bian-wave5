SD=Customer Campaign Design
CR= Customer Campaign Specification
BQs=      
This Service Domain designs and refines customer campaigns (or integrates designs from external campaign specialists). Customer campaigns target the existing customer base and can be proactive (involving customer targeting, contact and solicitation) or self-service and include activities such as cross-sell, up-sell and retention. Version numbering is used to track the impact of changes made to campaigns over their usage.
A retention campaign is updated to provide amended/improved pricing terms that can be offered to targeted customers to help retain their business after a poor response rate has been detected for the campaign
Design and refine customer campaign specifications based on their impact
