The underwriting decision considers the ability of the borrower to finance the loan based on their known cash flows and credit worthiness. The underwriting decision refers to specific properties of the proposed loan (amount, term, repayment schedule, collateral etc.), the income and known commitments of the borrower and their credit history with the bank. The decision may factor perceived underwriting risks into the interest rate and/or collateral requirements to obtain approval
