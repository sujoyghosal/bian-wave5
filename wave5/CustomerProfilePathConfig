sd=Customer Profile	This service domain maintains a small profile of key indicators for a customer that is referenced during customer interactions to facilitate routing, servicing and product/service fulfillment decisions. This can include status (such as account in arrears), ratings (such as high value customer) and alerts (such possible fraud activity detected) 	"Example of use:The identity and active status of a customer is checked as they present themselves on-line to access their bank account"	The customer profile service domain is used to tune the customer experience during any real-time interaction with the bank. A collection of status indicators, ratings and alerts can be maintained that are then used to influence the routing and servicing decisions that govern the customer interaction. For example a status indicator could include a warning that the account is in distress which would limit sales activity and might result in routing a contact to a specialist account recovery servicing facility.
