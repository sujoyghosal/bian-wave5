sd=Servicing Activity Analysis	This service domain analyzes servicing activity to support continual service improvement	Example of use: Contact center management reviews servicing activity analysis in order to identify areas where additional training and guidance is needed to improve the customer experience	Analyze customer servicing position activity, including teller, case/contact center traffic and VoIP activity. Analysis includes captured call/channel/device type, activity, onward routing and resolution decisions for operational and procedural insights and facility/process and training improvement (Root Cause Analysis)
