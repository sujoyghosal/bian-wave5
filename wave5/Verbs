Redemption Award
This service domain handles the allocation and redemption of rewards points for customer transaction activity. In order to determine the reward point transaction and apply associated costs the service domain will access reward point arrangement agreements with the customers, merchants and related rewards programs. Note that the interactions between reward programs can be quite complex when 3rd party reward programs are integrated with the bank's own reward programs
