The product specific terms and conditions are subordinate to the terms of the customer master agreement that is maintained by the Customer Agreement service domain. The product contractual terms and conditions influence product and service fulfillment for example by defining applicable fees/rates/penalties and selected features/options. Note that there can be other product configuration features that are not contractually binding - these features are maintained in the associated product/service fulfillment service domain directly"
