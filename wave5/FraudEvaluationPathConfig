sd=Fraud Evaluation	The service domain executes fraud behavioral pattern tests to detect possible fraudulent transactions/activity	Example of use:Card transactions are subjected to an array of fraud pattern test to detect 'out of pattern' behavior - anomalies are highlighted for analysis	This service domain handles the structured execution of fraud detection tests/routines that are used to identify possible fraud by detecting out of pattern behaviors. The tests may run in-line with production or may access transaction logs as appropriate. Detected anomalies are passed for further analysis and resolution.
