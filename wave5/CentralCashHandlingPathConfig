sd=Central Cash Handling	Track cash inventory, project demand and allocate inventory across the branch/ATM network	The central cash management function reviews the current and projected available float at locations across the network to ensure adequate supply to meet projected demand	This service domain is responsible for tracking the available cash inventory held centrally and distributed/collected throughout the branch/ATM network and making allocation/redistribution requests to ensure adequate float is available at all locations and that excess cash at any location is transferred to central secure locations as appropriate. Also coordinating with other banks and central banks to ensure sufficient cash is on hand to support the branch network requirements
