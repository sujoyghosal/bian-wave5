"The Current Account or Demand Deposit Account as it can be called is a financial facility that represents the general checking account facility at the core of the consumer and small business banking activity. There is a range of supporting features that make up the standard facility (checks/cheques, standing orders, debit cards, phone and on-line banking services etc.). The fulfillment can include a range of optional services, fees and interest payments and penalties and will often be bundled and or underlie/support other financial facilities and financial transactions"
A customer processes a series of services (e.g., request printed statements, initiate a transfer, set up a standing order) through the call center by accessing their current account
This service domain orchestrates a consumer checking/demand deposit account. The typical range of services and fees covers payments and deposits, standing orders, sweeps, liens, check and debit card access.
