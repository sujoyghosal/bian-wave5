Description	This service domain is used by the Card Acquiring bank to handle the authentication, authorization and submission of a Card payment from an e-commerce merchant. It supports the "3-D" Secure method of authentication which routes the authentication request to the Card Issuing Bank, which may use multi-factor authentication for the authentication of the Card and the Cardholder. It also handles the routing of the authorization request through the Card Transaction Switch service domain and the routing of the submitted charges to the Card Clearing service domain.

Example of Use	Example of use:When a Card is used for making a payment on an e-commerce site of a Merchant, the Merchant initiates three steps to process the payment: 1) request authentication of the Card and the Cardholder, 2) request an authorization of the charge amount, and 3) submit the charge details to the Card Acquirer for processing and payment.

Description	The card collection process relates to the determination and execution of the optimal strategy to ensure the collection of unsecured distressed card debt, which may include aggressive collection efforts, renegotiation of payments terms in order to improve customer commitment to make the payment, or to take any applicable legal actions against the customer.

Example of Use	Example of use:A card account is canceled when the age of outstanding balance exceeds policy limits (normally 90 days) or when delinquency management and dunning efforts are determined to be unsuccessful at eliciting payment. The account is then assigned to an internal Collections department or an external Collection Agency for making aggressive attempts at securing the payment of the outstandings.

Description	The proposed card transaction is requested by a merchant and routed through the Acquirer and Card Network to the Issuer. The authorization decision is automated and can be extremely complex. Transactions may be passed for manual checks by on-line service representatives for out of pattern purchases. Note that authorized transaction amounts may vary from the actual final amount (e.g. pre authorized hotel/car hire and charged meals excluding tips) and in cases there will be no financial transaction for an authorized transaction if the customer chooses to pay using a different card/cash. While this function is primarily performed by the Issuer, Acquirers and Card Networks may perform Stand-in Authorization and forward the results to the Issuer for recording.

Description	This function provides an interactive match of available products (and product combinations) to a customer based on customer type/characteristics, the context for the request and desired product/service features. The matching mechanism can prompt for additional details as may be necessary to select a product and/or confirm the eligibility of the customer. The facility can also consider broader factors such as business preferences/strategy and prevailing business/market conditions when selecting products.

Description	The Offer Management Service Domain can process offers for all types of customers and any allowed combination of product or service. It references the Product Directory for the product specific offer instructions it must follow. The offer process may combine the selection of product/service specific details (e.g. pricing & negotiation ranges, documentation/authorization/regulatory requirements, eligibility and declarations, credit and other customer details), customer specific details (e.g. credit standing, other classifications such as operational overhead/retention target/activity history, demographics and segmentation). The service domain orchestrates a potentially complex/multi-threaded/multi stage workflow to get the offer to the point where the product/service can be initiated.

Description	BIAN defines a customer contact as the overarching structure handling a customer interaction from start to end. A contact can include one or more servicing dialogue 'sessions' in parallel or sequence to support different device/channel uses within the contact and to allow for the customer to be passed on to different servicing specialists as necessary during the contact. Each session is handled at a servicing position where the Contact Dialogue service domain is called to handle the specific customer interaction.

Description	The customer contact dialogue handling capability can provide highly structured orchestration to streamline a customer interaction by consolidating and presenting customer related data in context. It can also use the session to gather additional customer intelligence. In a more advance implementation the customer interaction capabilities can be integrated into an automated self/service context in addition to the more conventional assisted service model. The structured customer dialogue can include tasks to check for other business activities that can be built into the exchange for example, delivering pending communications, sales/marketing attempts, capturing intelligence/triggers, updating relationship status/details, product fulfillment (such as synchronizing customer-side data). The facility can be designed to support multi-channel/multi-device deployments								E	E	E	E		E	E			IE	E							E	I	E							E	IE	E							E	IE	E							E	IE	E							E	IE	E							E	IE	E							E		Triggering
Example of Use	Example of use:A customer dials into the contact center with a current account balance request.

Executive Summary	This service domain handles/structures the customer narrative during an interactive session. It consolidates and presents pertinent customer information and provides servicing guidelines with standard dialogue/scripting as appropriate. It can include the capability to provoke questions to capture key relationship and sales triggers. It also ensures the correct sequencing, dialogue content and actions are performed/initiated during the customer interaction. It may further leverage the session by passing on customer notifications, status updates and triggering sales/marketing efforts.

Description	The customer profile service domain is used to tune the customer experience during any real-time interaction with the bank. A collection of status indicators, ratings and alerts can be maintained that are then used to influence the routing and servicing decisions that govern the customer interaction. For example a status indicator could include a warning that the account is in distress which would limit sales activity and might result in routing a contact to a specialist account recovery servicing facility.
