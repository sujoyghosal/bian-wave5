sd=Customer Case	This service domain handles the initiation, tracking, resolution and reporting on customer cases (issues that typically require corrective response to some financial transaction)	"A case resolution operator works through the resolution of a case, following the established process for the specific case - in this case a disputed charge that is below a threshold allowing the credit to be charged to the merchant"	Case resolution tasks follow specific procedures for the type of case involved. Case resolution can be quick by applying resolution rules and obtaining additional authorization as necessary, or they can be long living activities, for example where documentation is requested and has to be retrieved from merchants or other interested parties before the disputed issue can finally be ruled upon. A wide range of case types can be expected
