"The Servicing Order service domain handles the processing of a request that may impact multiple products and services and may involve processing cycles/steps and possibly have associated fees/charges. There can be several types of standard 'servicing order' defined for selection as appropriate. A servicing order can be initiated by a customer directly or may be requested on their behalf by an authorized third party service provider. If the request is made by a third party service provider on behalf of a customer the process can include a check that the associated permissions/mandates are in place"
"A customer changes address and requests that all of their product and service arrangements are updated"
This service domain handles the processing of a customer servicing request as a predefined procedure. A range of standard servicing requests can be supported. The process can include a check of permissions when the request is made by a third party/service provider
